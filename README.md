# Interest Computer

A simple, static webapp that calculates compound interest.

It accomplishes this by having the user input the principal, interest rate, how often per year interest is compounded, and how many years the money is accumulating interest.

The web app returns the amount of money that was accumulated and total amount once the "Calculate!" button is clicked.
